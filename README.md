## The project

The project is an unofficial AniList application that just makes use of their API. To fill my boredom i developed this simple app that queries a
GraphQL API (AniList) and returns a potential suggestion. The main purpose was to just get some hands-on experience with FrontEnd MVC, GraphQL and
handling forms.

### Abandoned
There's a rate limit and there doesn't seem to be a reliable way to get a random anime using this API. The only good thing that came out of
this might be the GraphQL query builder.
